## Introduction

Contained in this directory are the following files
    * Plot1.R - The file that plots Plot1.png
    * Plot2.R - The file that plots Plot2.png
    * Plot3.R - The file that plots Plot3.png
    * Plot4.R - The file that plots Plot4.png
    * Plot1.png - Plot1 for the assignment
    * Plot2.png - Plot2 for the assignment
    * Plot3.png - Plot3 for the assignment
    * Plot4.png - Plot4 for the assignment
    * read\_data.R - Helper file for all 4 plots.

In order to run the plots correctly you *MUST* include read\_data.R. Do not assume reproducible means that all code must be stored in the same file

In order to utilise good programming practices, common utilities and calls have been placed into read\_data.R

## Plots made for the assignment
